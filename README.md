Crime Analytics at UB(my school)

If my click or google search could get my Youtube ad pop-up in seconds, why can't we use the data for greater-good of to help Police Department in detecting crime patterns for student's safety(Hot Topic!)?

This is only inspiration for my project! I'm working with my school's Police officials to come up with an Application to help them detecting patterns and forecasts for the future based on the past crime records.

Application is in development stage and would be shared once I'm done with my final coding as requirements change requires code changes! Visit this page after 2 weeks to share my knowledge on crime analytics at my school! Thanks!
